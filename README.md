# Introduction
The goal of **AHAAB** is to adderess deficiencies in current tools that use primarily sequence-based or amino-acid specific features for predicing antigen-HLA binding affinity. By featurizing models of peptides bound to HLA variants, **AHAAB** can accurately predict binding affinity for a wider variety of antigens containing post-translational modifications or other less common amino acid variants.
